Subject: Webhook Reactivation Request - Configuration Fixed

Dear Robaws Support Team,

Our webhook endpoint was suspended due to configuration issues on our end. We have now resolved these issues and request reactivation.

**Webhook Details:**
- URL: https://app.belgaco.be/api/webhooks/robaws/articles
- Webhook ID: 5a3f8595-cba7-454f-b389-357fa2bf6c49
- Events: article.created, article.updated, article.stock-changed

**Issues Resolved:**
1. ✅ Properly configured webhook signature verification
2. ✅ Set up comprehensive webhook logging and monitoring
3. ✅ Added rate limiting (60 requests/minute)
4. ✅ Implemented health checks and alerting
5. ✅ Tested endpoint successfully

**Configuration:**
- Secret: 090bed9b-8e8c-4aa9-a80d-315eb63b35d6
- Signature verification: HMAC-SHA256
- Monitoring: Active with hourly health checks

**Testing:**
We have successfully tested the webhook endpoint locally and confirmed:
- Signature verification is working correctly
- All webhook events are being processed
- Logging and monitoring are active
- Rate limiting is properly configured

Could you please reactivate our webhook? We are ready to receive webhook events and have implemented comprehensive monitoring to prevent future issues.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Patrick
