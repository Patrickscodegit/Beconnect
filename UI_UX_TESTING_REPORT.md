## üêõ ISSUES FOUND

### üî¥ Critical Issues
**None** ‚úÖ

### üü° Minor Issues

#### Issue #1: Routing Field Validation
**Severity**: LOW  
**Impact**: Programmatic quotation creation fails without routing array  
**Status**: Not blocking  
**Fix**: Add routing field to programmatic tests OR ensure UI forms always provide it  

**Recommended Fix**:
```php
// In ProspectQuotationController and CustomerQuotationController
// Add this to data preparation:
'routing' => [
    'por' => $request->por,
    'pol' => $request->pol,
    'pod' => $request->pod,
    'fdest' => $request->fdest,
]
```

**Note**: This is likely already handled by the UI forms. Only affects direct model creation.
