# ðŸŽ‰ Intake-Scoped Deduplication Implementation Complete

## âœ… Problem Solved

**Issue**: Extract Data button was missing from new intakes (like Intake #6) because the deduplication system was working globally instead of per-intake. When the same email was uploaded to a different intake, it was marked as a duplicate even though it should be processed separately for each intake.

**Root Cause**: The `findExistingDocument()` method in `EmailDocumentService` was checking for duplicates across ALL intakes instead of scoping the check to the current intake.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### 1. Updated `EmailDocumentService::findExistingDocument()`
- Added `intakeId` parameter to scope duplicate checks per intake
- Modified database query to include `where('intake_id', $intakeId)` 
- Now checks: "Is this email a duplicate **within this specific intake**?"

### 2. Enhanced `EmailDocumentService::isDuplicate()` Response
- Returns both `document_id` and `document` for convenience
- Added `matched_on` field showing whether match was by 'message_id' or 'content_sha'
- Improved error handling with consistent return structure

### 3. Updated All Method Calls
- `ingestStoredEmail()` now passes `intakeId` to duplicate checks
- `isDuplicate()` accepts optional `intakeId` parameter
- `getDocumentByFingerprint()` updated for compatibility

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite
- Created `/tests/Feature/EmailDeduplicationTest.php` with 3 test scenarios:
  - âœ… Basic intake-scoped deduplication
  - âœ… Content SHA matching when Message-ID differs  
  - âœ… Cross-intake behavior (allows same email in different intakes)

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Logic

### Before (Global Deduplication)
```
Same Email + Any Intake = DUPLICATE â†’ No Extract Data Button
```

### After (Intake-Scoped Deduplication)  
```
Same Email + Same Intake = DUPLICATE â†’ No Extract Data Button
Same Email + Different Intake = NOT DUPLICATE â†’ Extract Data Button Shows âœ…
```

## ðŸ”— Database Schema
The existing unique constraints work perfectly for intake-scoped deduplication:
- `source_message_id` + `intake_id` uniqueness 
- `source_content_sha` + `intake_id` uniqueness

## ðŸ§ª Test Results
All tests passing:
- âœ… Deduplicates per intake using the ingestion path (10 assertions)
- âœ… Detects duplicates by content SHA when message ID differs
- âœ… Prevents duplicates within same intake but allows across different intakes

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The fix is now live and ready. When you:

1. **Upload the same email to the same intake** â†’ Correctly flagged as duplicate, no Extract Data button
2. **Upload the same email to a different intake** â†’ NOT flagged as duplicate, Extract Data button appears âœ…

This gives you the perfect balance:
- âœ… No duplicate processing within the same business context (intake)
- âœ… Flexibility to process the same email in different business contexts
- âœ… Clean UI that shows Extract Data when extraction is actually needed

## ðŸŽŠ Impact

- **Extract Data button will now appear** for Intake #6 and any future intakes with the same email
- **Deduplication still prevents** waste within the same intake
- **Business workflow restored** - each intake can be processed independently
- **Maintains all existing protections** against true duplicates

The intake-scoped deduplication system is now working exactly as intended! ðŸŽ¯
