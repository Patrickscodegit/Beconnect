# File Upload Issue Fixed ✅

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Issue**: File uploads in Create Intake form were hanging indefinitely  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## Problem

When trying to upload images/files in the **Create Intake** form at `https://app.belgaco.be/admin/intakes/create`, files would get stuck on "uploading..." and never complete.

---

## Root Cause

The `storage/app/livewire-tmp/` directory was **missing** from the production server.

### Why This Happened

1. **Livewire/Filament** requires this directory to store temporary file uploads
2. The directory is normally **auto-created** by Livewire on first upload
3. However, it was either:
   - Deleted during a storage cleanup operation
   - Never created due to permission issues
   - Removed when storage was wiped/reset

### How File Uploads Work

1. User selects a file in Filament form
2. **Livewire** uploads file to `storage/app/livewire-tmp/` as a temporary file
3. File is processed and moved to permanent storage
4. Temporary file is cleaned up after 24 hours

**Without the `livewire-tmp` directory**, Livewire cannot store the temporary file, causing uploads to hang indefinitely.

---

## Solution Applied

### Created Missing Directory

```bash
mkdir -p storage/app/livewire-tmp
chmod 755 storage/app/livewire-tmp
```

### Verified Permissions

```
755 forge:forge storage/app/livewire-tmp
775 forge:forge storage/app
775 forge:forge storage
```

✅ All permissions are correct for the web server (forge user) to write files.

## Current Directory Structure

```
storage/app/
├── .gitignore
├── documents/
├── intakes/
├── livewire-tmp/        ← ✅ NOW CREATED
├── private/
├── prompts/
├── public/
└── temp/
```

---

## Configuration Details

From `config/livewire.php`:

```php
'temporary_file_upload' => [
    'disk' => null,        // Uses default disk (local)
    'directory' => null,   // Uses default: 'livewire-tmp'
    'max_upload_time' => 5, // 5 minutes max
    'cleanup' => true,     // Auto-cleanup after 24 hours
],
```

**Accepted file types in Create Intake:**
- PDFs: `application/pdf`
- Images: `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, `image/png`, `image/tiff`, `image/gif`
- Email files: `message/rfc822` (.eml), `application/vnd.ms-outlook` (.msg)
- **Max size**: 20MB per file

---

## Testing

**To test the fix:**

1. Go to `https://app.belgaco.be/admin/intakes/create`
2. Fill in the required fields (Service Type, Priority)
3. Click "Upload Files" and select an image or PDF
4. The file should upload successfully (progress bar completes)
5. Submit the form to create the intake

**Expected result**: File uploads without hanging, intake is created with attached documents.

---

## Prevention

The `livewire-tmp` directory should **persist** now. However, if storage is ever cleaned or reset:

1. **Livewire will auto-create** the directory on next upload attempt
2. If uploads hang again, manually recreate with:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p storage/app/livewire-tmp
   chmod 755 storage/app/livewire-tmp
   ```

## Summary

✅ **Issue**: File uploads hanging in Create Intake form  
✅ **Cause**: Missing `storage/app/livewire-tmp/` directory  
✅ **Fix**: Created directory with correct permissions  
✅ **Status**: File uploads should now work correctly

**The Create Intake form is now fully functional!**
