✅ Total columns: 26
```

---

### 2. Service Types Configuration ✅

```json
✅ 17 service types loaded from config('quotation.service_types')
✅ Service types include:
   - RORO_EXPORT
   - RORO_IMPORT
   - FCL_EXPORT
   - FCL_IMPORT
   - FCL_EXPORT_CONSOL
   - FCL_IMPORT_CONSOL
   - LCL_EXPORT

### 3. Model Fillable Field ✅
**Test:** Verify `service_type` is in Intake model's fillable array

**Result:**
```
✅ service_type in fillable: YES
```

---

### 4. Service Type Name Mapping ✅
**Test:** Verify service type keys map to human-readable names

**Result:**
```json
✅ Mapping works correctly:
   "RORO_EXPORT" => "RORO Export"
   "RORO_IMPORT" => "RORO Import"
   "FCL_EXPORT" => "FCL Export"
   "FCL_IMPORT_CONSOL" => "FCL Import Vehicle Consol"
   "AIRFREIGHT_EXPORT" => "Airfreight Export"
```

### 5. Form Data Mutation ✅
**Test:** Verify `mutateFormDataBeforeCreate` auto-sets status and source

**Input:**
```json
{
    "service_type": "RORO_EXPORT",
    "priority": "normal",
    "notes": "Test note",
    "customer_name": "Test Customer"
}
```

**Output after mutation:**
```json
{
    "service_type": "RORO_EXPORT",
    "priority": "normal",
    "notes": "Test note",
    "customer_name": "Test Customer",
    "status": "pending",        // ✅ Auto-added
    "source": "manual_upload"   // ✅ Auto-added
}
```

### 6. Intake Creation with Service Type ✅
**Test:** Create actual intake record with service_type

**Result:**
```
✅ Intake created successfully!
   ID: 31
   Service Type: RORO_EXPORT
   Status: pending
   Source: manual_upload
   Service Type Name: RORO Export

✅ Test intake deleted (cleanup successful)
```

### 7. Table Column Formatting ✅
**Test:** Verify table column displays formatted service type names

**Test Cases:**
```
Input                     => Output
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

AIRFREIGHT_EXPORT         => Airfreight Export         ✅
null                      => —                          ✅
INVALID_TYPE              => INVALID_TYPE               ✅
```
