## How to Use

2. Articles are automatically enhanced with commodity_type and pod_code
3. No additional action needed

### For Existing Articles (One-Time Backfill)
To populate the 1,580 existing articles:
1. Go to Admin Panel â†’ Articles
2. Click **"Sync Extra Fields"** button (blue button)
3. Confirm the operation
4. Wait ~30-60 minutes for background processing
5. All articles will have enhanced fields populated

## What Gets Extracted

### Commodity Type

- Big Van
- Small Van
- Car
- SUV
- Truck
- Container

- etc.

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Enhancement**: All syncs now populate enhanced fields
2. **Complete Data**: Existing articles can be backfilled via "Sync Extra Fields"
3. **Smart Article Selection**: System has complete data for intelligent filtering
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Extraction failures don't break sync process
6. **Zero Additional API Calls**: Uses existing article data

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration**: Ensure database has commodity_type and pod_code fields
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Backfill Existing Articles**: Click "Sync Extra Fields" button in admin panel
   - This will take ~30-60 minutes
   - Runs in background queue
   - Processes all 1,580 articles

3. **Verify Smart Suggestions**: After backfill completes
   - Open a quotation request
   - Check if smart article suggestions appear
   - Verify match percentages and reasons

## Technical Details

### Error Handling
- Enhancement extraction is wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Failures are logged but don't break the sync process
- Fields default to null if extraction fails
- Non-critical errors use Log::debug to avoid noise

### Performance
- No additional API calls required
- Uses existing article data from sync
- Minimal performance impact (< 1ms per article)
- Background processing for bulk operations

### Data Quality
- Extraction methods handle various Robaws data formats
- Gracefully handles missing or malformed data
- Logs extraction failures for debugging
- Can be re-run safely without side effects

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Enhancement calls are non-breaking (fields can be null)
2. Can disable by commenting out enhancement service calls
3. Existing sync functionality remains unchanged
4. No data loss - only new fields affected
