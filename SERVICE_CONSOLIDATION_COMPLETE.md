## 🧪 **Testing Results**

```bash
php artisan audit:robaws-services
```

**Output:**
```
🔍 Auditing Robaws Services
================================
1. Testing Service Instantiation
✅ EnhancedRobawsIntegrationService (consolidated) - OK
✅ SimpleRobawsIntegration - OK (deprecated)
✅ EnhancedRobawsIntegrationService - OK
2. Checking Database Schema
✅ Field 'robaws_sync_status' exists
✅ Field 'robaws_formatted_at' exists
3. Testing Document Processing
✅ EnhancedRobawsIntegrationService::createOfferFromDocument - OK
✅ SimpleRobawsIntegration::getDocumentsReadyForExport - OK
4. Checking for Redundant Services
✅ Redundant service removed: app/Services/RobawsService.php
✅ Redundant service removed: app/Services/RobawsIntegrationService.php
✅ Audit complete!
```
