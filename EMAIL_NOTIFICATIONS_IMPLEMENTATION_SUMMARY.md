## ⚠️ Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to `.env`

**IMPORTANT:** You need to manually add these variables to your `.env` file (the file is blocked by `.gitignore`):

```env
# Email Notification Settings
# Set to 'true' during testing to prevent sending emails to real customers
# All emails will be redirected to MAIL_TESTING_ADDRESS instead
MAIL_TESTING_MODE=true
MAIL_TESTING_ADDRESS="patrick@belgaco.be"

# Team notification email (receives quotation submission notifications)
MAIL_TEAM_ADDRESS="info@belgaco.be"
```

If you don't already have mail configuration, also add:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailpit
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@belgaco.be"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### Step 2: Add to `.env.example` (Optional)

For documentation purposes, add the same variables to `.env.example` with comments.

### Step 3: Clear Configuration Cache

After adding environment variables, run:

```bash
cd /Users/patrickhome/Documents/Robaws2025_AI/Bconnect
php artisan config:cache
```

## 🧪 Testing the Email System

### Quick Test with Tinker

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Get a test quotation
$quotation = \App\Models\QuotationRequest::first();

// Test team notification
Notification::route('mail', config('mail.team_address'))
    ->notify(new \App\Notifications\QuotationSubmittedNotification($quotation));

// Test customer notification
Notification::route('mail', $quotation->contact_email)
    ->notify(new \App\Notifications\QuotationQuotedNotification($quotation));
```

### Full Workflow Test

1. **Submit a quotation** (as prospect or customer)
   - Check that team receives notification at `MAIL_TESTING_ADDRESS`

2. **Mark as quoted** (in Filament admin)
   - Check that customer email is sent to `MAIL_TESTING_ADDRESS`

3. **Mark as accepted/rejected**
   - Check that status changed email is sent to `MAIL_TESTING_ADDRESS`

### Using Mailpit (Recommended for Local Testing)

If using Laravel Sail or Mailpit:

1. Start Mailpit: `./vendor/bin/sail up -d` (if using Sail)
2. Access web interface: `http://localhost:8025`
3. All test emails will appear there

## 📧 Email Notification Flow

### 1. Quotation Submitted → Team Notification

**Trigger points:**
- Prospect submits quotation via `/public/quotations/create`
- Customer submits quotation via `/customer/quotations/create`
- Intake auto-creates quotation (when status becomes `processing_complete`)

**Recipients:** `MAIL_TEAM_ADDRESS` (e.g., info@belgaco.be)

**Email includes:**
- Request number
- Customer information
- Shipment details
- Link to Filament admin

### 2. Quotation Quoted → Customer Notification

**Trigger point:**
- Admin clicks "Mark as Quoted" in Filament

**Recipients:** Customer's `contact_email`

**Email includes:**
- Pricing details
- Valid until date
- Links to view/accept quotation

### 3. Status Changed → Customer Notification

**Trigger points:**
- Admin clicks "Mark as Accepted"
- Admin clicks "Mark as Rejected"

**Recipients:** Customer's `contact_email`

**Email includes:**
- Status-specific message
- Next steps
- Contact information

## 🔒 Email Safety Features

### Test Mode Protection

When `MAIL_TESTING_MODE=true`:
- ✅ All emails redirect to `MAIL_TESTING_ADDRESS`

- ✅ Original recipient logged for debugging
- ✅ Safe to test with production data

### Error Handling

- All notification triggers wrapped in try-catch
- Email failures logged but don't break workflow
- Null checks for email addresses
- Graceful degradation
