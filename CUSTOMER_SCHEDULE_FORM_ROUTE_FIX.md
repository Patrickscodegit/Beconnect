# Customer Schedule Form Route Fix

## Problem

When filtering schedules on the **customer schedules page** (`/customer/schedules`), the form was submitting to the **public schedules** route, causing users to be redirected to a different page with different branding.

### User Experience Issue

1. User visits `/customer/schedules` → Sees "Belgaco" branding ✅
2. User applies filters (selects POL/POD) → Form submits
3. User redirected to `/public/schedules?pol=ANR&pod=CKY...` → Sees "Bconnect Local" branding ❌
4. Layout changes unexpectedly, losing customer context

## Root Cause

**File**: `resources/views/customer/schedules/index.blade.php` (Line 17)

**Incorrect Form Action**:
```html
<form method="GET" action="{{ route('public.schedules.index') }}" class="space-y-4">
```

The form was pointing to the public schedules route instead of the customer schedules route.

## Solution

### Code Change

**File**: `resources/views/customer/schedules/index.blade.php` (Line 17)

**Before**:
```html
<form method="GET" action="{{ route('public.schedules.index') }}" class="space-y-4">
```

**After**:
```html
<form method="GET" action="{{ route('customer.schedules.index') }}" class="space-y-4">
```

### Route Details

- **Customer schedules route**: `customer.schedules.index` → `/customer/schedules`
- **Public schedules route**: `public.schedules.index` → `/public/schedules`

The form now correctly submits to the customer route.

## Benefits

### 1. Consistent User Experience ✅
- Users stay on the customer portal when filtering
- "Belgaco" branding maintained throughout
- No unexpected layout changes

### 2. Proper Context Preservation ✅
- Customer authentication context preserved
- Correct navigation menu displayed
- Appropriate user profile shown

### 3. Better UX Flow ✅
- Filtering feels natural and seamless
- No confusing redirect to different portal
- Clear separation between public and customer areas

## Testing

### Before Fix
1. Visit `/customer/schedules` (Belgaco layout)
2. Select POL: Antwerp, POD: Conakry
3. Click "Apply Filters"
4. **Redirected to** `/public/schedules?pol=ANR&pod=CKY` (Bconnect Local layout) ❌

### After Fix
1. Visit `/customer/schedules` (Belgaco layout)
2. Select POL: Antwerp, POD: Conakry
3. Click "Apply Filters"
4. **Stays on** `/customer/schedules?pol=ANR&pod=CKY` (Belgaco layout) ✅

### Verification URLs

**Test the fix**:
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/customer/schedules
2. Apply any filter combination
3. Verify URL stays as `/customer/schedules?...`
4. Verify "Belgaco" branding is maintained

**Compare with public** (should still work):
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/public/schedules
2. Apply filters
3. Verify URL stays as `/public/schedules?...`
4. Verify "Bconnect Local" branding is maintained

## Technical Details

### Cache Cleared
```bash
php artisan view:clear
```

- Backward compatible with all existing features
