# Trade Direction Field Removal

## Summary
Removed the redundant "Trade Direction" field from quotation forms. The direction is now automatically derived from the service type since it already indicates whether it's Export, Import, Cross Trade, or Both.

## Business Logic Change

### Before
- Users had to select BOTH:
  1. **Service Type**: e.g., "RORO Export"
  2. **Trade Direction**: "Export" or "Import"
- This was redundant and confusing

### After
- Users only select **Service Type**: e.g., "RORO Export"
- System auto-derives direction: "export"
- One less field = simpler UX

## Direction Derivation Logic

```php
private function getDirectionFromServiceType(string $serviceType): string
{
    if (str_contains($serviceType, '_EXPORT')) {
        return 'export';
    }
    if (str_contains($serviceType, '_IMPORT')) {
        return 'import';
    }
    if ($serviceType === 'CROSSTRADE') {
        return 'cross_trade';
    }
    // For ROAD_TRANSPORT, CUSTOMS, PORT_FORWARDING, OTHER
    return 'both';
}
```

## Service Type → Direction Mapping

### Export Services (6)
- `RORO_EXPORT` → export
- `FCL_EXPORT` → export
- `FCL_EXPORT_CONSOL` → export
- `LCL_EXPORT` → export
- `BB_EXPORT` → export
- `AIRFREIGHT_EXPORT` → export

### Import Services (6)
- `RORO_IMPORT` → import
- `FCL_IMPORT` → import
- `FCL_IMPORT_CONSOL` → import
- `LCL_IMPORT` → import
- `BB_IMPORT` → import
- `AIRFREIGHT_IMPORT` → import

### Cross Trade Services (1)
- `CROSSTRADE` → cross_trade

### Both/Other Services (4)
- `ROAD_TRANSPORT` → both
- `CUSTOMS` → both
- `PORT_FORWARDING` → both
- `OTHER` → both

## Files Modified

### 1. Public Quotation Form (Prospect Portal)

**File**: `resources/views/public/quotations/create.blade.php`
- ✅ Removed trade_direction select field
- Form now only shows service_type dropdown

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ProspectQuotationController.php`
- ✅ Removed `'trade_direction' => 'required|string|in:import,export'` validation
- ✅ Added `getDirectionFromServiceType()` helper method
- ✅ Changed storage: `'trade_direction' => $this->getDirectionFromServiceType($request->service_type)`

### 2. Customer Quotation Form (Customer Portal)

**File**: `resources/views/customer/quotations/create.blade.php`
- ✅ Removed trade_direction select field
- Form now only shows service_type dropdown

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/CustomerQuotationController.php`
- ✅ Removed `'trade_direction' => 'required|string|in:import,export'` validation
- ✅ Added `getDirectionFromServiceType()` helper method
- ✅ Changed storage: `'trade_direction' => $this->getDirectionFromServiceType($request->service_type)`

### 3. Filament Admin Panel

**File**: `app/Filament/Resources/QuotationRequestResource.php`
- ✅ Updated Hidden `trade_direction` field to auto-calculate
- ✅ Added `afterStateHydrated()` to set initial value from service_type
- ✅ Added `dehydrateStateUsing()` to always derive from service_type
- ✅ Added static `getDirectionFromServiceType()` method

### 4. Display Views (No Changes)

These views display the stored value and didn't need modification:
- `resources/views/public/quotations/confirmation.blade.php`
- `resources/views/emails/quotation-submitted.blade.php`
- `resources/views/customer/quotations/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/public/quotations/status.blade.php`

## Database Impact

**No Migration Needed:**
- `trade_direction` column remains in `quotation_requests` table
- Column kept for backward compatibility
- Existing quotations continue to display correctly
- New quotations auto-populate direction from service type

**Schema** (unchanged):
```php
$table->string('service_type'); // FCL_EXPORT, RORO_IMPORT, etc.
$table->string('trade_direction'); // export, import, cross_trade, both
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible:**
- Existing quotations with trade_direction values unchanged
- Display logic uses stored value
- New quotations get auto-derived value
- No breaking changes

## Testing Results

### Direction Derivation Test

All 17 service types correctly mapped:

```
✓ RORO_EXPORT               → export       
✓ RORO_IMPORT               → import       
✓ FCL_EXPORT                → export       
✓ FCL_IMPORT                → import       
✓ FCL_EXPORT_CONSOL         → export       
✓ FCL_IMPORT_CONSOL         → import       
✓ LCL_EXPORT                → export       
✓ LCL_IMPORT                → import       
✓ BB_EXPORT                 → export       
✓ BB_IMPORT                 → import       
✓ AIRFREIGHT_EXPORT         → export       
✓ AIRFREIGHT_IMPORT         → import       
✓ CROSSTRADE                → cross_trade  
✓ ROAD_TRANSPORT            → both         
✓ CUSTOMS                   → both         
✓ PORT_FORWARDING           → both         
✓ OTHER                     → both         

Summary:
  Export: 6 services
  Import: 6 services
  Cross Trade: 1 service
  Both/Other: 4 services
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Visit `/public/quotations/create` - verify NO trade_direction field
- [ ] Select "RORO Export" service type - submit quotation
- [ ] Verify quotation saved with `trade_direction='export'`
- [ ] Visit `/customer/quotations/create` - verify NO trade_direction field
- [ ] Select "FCL Import" service type - submit quotation
- [ ] Verify quotation saved with `trade_direction='import'`
- [ ] Check Filament admin - verify direction auto-calculated
- [ ] Select "CUSTOMS" service type - verify `trade_direction='both'`
- [ ] Verify existing quotations still display correctly

## Benefits

1. **Simplified UX**: One less redundant field for users
2. **Reduced Errors**: No risk of mismatched service type and direction
3. **Cleaner Forms**: Less visual clutter
4. **Consistent Logic**: Direction always matches service type
5. **Maintainable**: Single source of truth (service type determines direction)

## User Experience Improvement

### Before
```
Service Type: [RORO Export ▼]
Trade Direction: [Export ▼]   ← Redundant!
```

### After
```
Service Type: [RORO Export ▼]
                               ← Direction auto-derived!
```

The service type name already tells us it's "Export" - no need to ask again!

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Display Direction Badge
Show a read-only badge derived from service type:

```blade
<div class="mt-2">
    <span class="badge badge-{{ $direction === 'export' ? 'blue' : 'green' }}">
        {{ ucfirst($direction) }} Direction
    </span>
</div>
```

### Database Cleanup (Optional)
After verifying all works correctly, could optionally:
1. Run migration to drop `trade_direction` column
2. Or keep it for reporting/analytics purposes

## Git Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Remove redundant trade_direction field from quotation forms

Business Logic Change:
- Removed 'Trade Direction' dropdown from all quotation forms
- Direction is now auto-derived from service type
- Service type already indicates direction (e.g., RORO Export, RORO Import)

Files Modified:
1. resources/views/public/quotations/create.blade.php - Removed trade_direction field
2. resources/views/customer/quotations/create.blade.php - Removed trade_direction field
3. app/Http/Controllers/ProspectQuotationController.php:
   - Removed validation rule
   - Added getDirectionFromServiceType() helper
   - Auto-derive direction when storing quotation
4. app/Http/Controllers/CustomerQuotationController.php:
   - Removed validation rule
   - Added getDirectionFromServiceType() helper
   - Auto-derive direction when storing quotation
5. app/Filament/Resources/QuotationRequestResource.php:
   - Updated Hidden field to auto-calculate from service_type
   - Added static getDirectionFromServiceType() method

Direction Mapping Logic:
- Contains '_EXPORT' → export (6 services)
- Contains '_IMPORT' → import (6 services)
- CROSSTRADE → cross_trade (1 service)
- Others → both (ROAD_TRANSPORT, CUSTOMS, PORT_FORWARDING, OTHER)

Database Impact:
- No migration needed
- trade_direction column kept for backward compatibility
- New quotations auto-populate direction
- Existing quotations unchanged

Result: Simplified UX - one less redundant field for users to fill"
