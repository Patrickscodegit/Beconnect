## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. **Backend API Endpoint**

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ScheduleSearchController.php` (NEW)

- **Route**: `GET /api/schedules/search`
- **Parameters**: `pol`, `pod`, `service_type` (optional)
- **Returns**: JSON array of available schedules
- **Features**:
  - Filters schedules by POL/POD ports
  - Includes carrier, route, dates, transit time
  - Error handling and logging
  - Formatted response with success/message

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Found 3 schedule(s)",
  "schedules": [
    {
      "id": 5,
      "label": "MSC - Antwerp → Lagos | Departs: Oct 25, 2025 | Transit: 21 days",
      "carrier": "MSC",
      "carrier_code": "MSC",
      "pol": "Antwerp",
      "pol_code": "BEANR",
      "pod": "Lagos",
      "pod_code": "NGLOS",
      "departure_date": "2025-10-25",
      "transit_days": 21,
      "service_name": "WAX",
      "frequency": "Weekly"
    }
  ],
  "count": 3
}
```

### 2. **Frontend Schedule Selection Section**

**Added to**:
- `resources/views/customer/quotations/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/public/quotations/create.blade.php`

**Location**: Between "Service Information" and "Cargo Information" sections

**Features**:
- ✅ Dynamic dropdown populated via AJAX
- ✅ Real-time filtering (updates when POL/POD changes)
- ✅ Loading states ("Searching for available sailings...")
- ✅ Empty state handling ("No sailings available")
- ✅ Selected schedule details display
- ✅ Optional field (users can skip it)
- ✅ Persists on validation errors (`old()` support)
- ✅ Mobile responsive

**UI Components**:
1. **Dropdown** - Shows available sailings
2. **Loading Indicator** - Spinner while fetching
3. **Details Card** - Shows selected sailing info (carrier, route, dates)

### 3. **Alpine.js Component**

**Function**: `scheduleSelector()`

**Features**:
- Watches POL/POD select fields for changes
- Fetches schedules from API endpoint
- Manages loading states
- Displays schedule details
- Resets selection when POL/POD changes

**Code**:
```javascript
function scheduleSelector() {
    return {
        schedules: [],
        selectedSchedule: '',
        loading: false,
        polSelected: false,
        podSelected: false,
        
        init() { /* Setup watchers */ },
        fetchSchedules() { /* AJAX call */ },
        selectedScheduleDetails() { /* Format display */ }
    }
}
```

### 4. **Controller Updates**

**Files**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/ProspectQuotationController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/CustomerQuotationController.php`

**Changes**:
- Added validation rule: `'selected_schedule_id' => 'nullable|exists:shipping_schedules,id'`
- Added to `$data` array: `'selected_schedule_id' => $request->selected_schedule_id`
- Saves to database when form submitted

### 5. **Route Registration**

**File**: `routes/web.php`

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\Api\ScheduleSearchController;

Route::get('/api/schedules/search', [ScheduleSearchController::class, 'search'])
    ->name('api.schedules.search');
```
