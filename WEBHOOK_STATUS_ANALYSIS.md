# 🔍 Webhook Status Analysis (2025-10-21 05:00)

## Current Situation

### ✅ **Good News**
1. **Webhooks ARE working!** The latest logs show successful webhook reception:
   - `05:00:44` - Webhook received for article 1834
   - `05:00:52` - Webhook received for article 1834
   - Both returned HTTP 200 responses

2. **Custom field fix is deployed** - The code now correctly extracts `parent_item` from `custom_fields`

3. **Signature verification working** (with timestamp validation)

### ❌ **The Real Problem**

**Article 1834 is NOT in the cache!**

```
ERROR: Failed to sync article metadata
{"article_id":"1834","error":"Article not found in cache: 1834"}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The webhook processing has two steps:
1. ✅ **Receive webhook** - WORKING
2. ❌ **Update cached article** - FAILING because article doesn't exist in cache

### Why Article 1834 Isn't in Cache

Looking at the webhook payload structure, Robaws sends:
- `data.id` = "1834" (String, not integer)
- `data.extraFields.C965754A-4523-4916-A127-3522DE1A7001.booleanValue` = true/false (Parent Item)

The sync service expects:
- Article to already exist in `robaws_articles_cache` table
- Then it updates the article with webhook data

**But if the article was never synced initially, the webhook can't update it!**

## The Fix

### Step 1: Initial Sync
Run the full article sync to populate the cache:
```bash
php artisan robaws:sync-articles
```

OR sync just article 1834:
```php
$service = app(\App\Services\Quotation\RobawsArticlesSyncService::class);
$service->syncSingleArticle('1834');
```

### Step 2: Test Webhook
Once article is in cache, webhooks will work perfectly:
1. Change "Parent Item" in Robaws
2. Webhook fires
3. Article updates in cache
4. Changes visible in Filament ✅

## Webhook Payload Mapping

From the logs, we can see Robaws sends:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1834",
    "extraFields": {
      "C965754A-4523-4916-A127-3522DE1A7001": {
        "booleanValue": true  // This is the Parent Item checkbox
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Our fix in `RobawsArticlesSyncService.php`:
```php
'is_parent_article' => $article['custom_fields']['parent_item'] ?? false,
```

**Wait... There's a mismatch!**

The webhook sends `extraFields` but our code looks for `custom_fields`!

## 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY

The webhook payload uses `extraFields`, but our sync service expects `custom_fields`.

We need to check if the `RobawsArticleProvider` is transforming `extraFields` to `custom_fields` before passing to the sync service.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix is already deployed (extracts from custom_fields)
2. ⚠️  Need to verify field mapping: `extraFields` → `custom_fields`
3. 🔄 Sync article 1834 to cache
4. 🧪 Test webhook again
