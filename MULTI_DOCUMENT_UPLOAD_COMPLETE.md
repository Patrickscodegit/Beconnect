# Multi-Document PDF Upload Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 **Implementation Summary**

**COMPLETE MULTI-DOCUMENT UPLOAD SYSTEM** - Full implementation of PDF and multi-format file upload to Robaws platform with automatic batch processing, size-based routing, and comprehensive error handling.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Components**

### **1. RobawsClient.php** - Complete File Upload API
```php
✅ uploadDirectToEntity()      - Small files ≤6MB direct upload
✅ createTempBucket()         - Large file temporary bucket creation  
✅ uploadToBucket()           - Large file >6MB upload to bucket
✅ attachDocumentFromBucket() - Attach large files from bucket to entity
✅ uploadMultipleDocuments()  - Intelligent batch processing
✅ testConnection()           - API connectivity testing
```

### **2. MultiDocumentUploadService.php** - Business Logic
```php
✅ uploadQuotationDocuments() - Upload all documents for a quotation
✅ uploadDocumentToQuotation() - Single document upload
✅ retryFailedUploads()       - Retry failed uploads with error handling
✅ getUploadStatus()          - Comprehensive upload status tracking
✅ collectQuotationDocuments() - Smart document collection by quotation/intake
```

### **3. Database Schema Enhancement**
```sql
✅ robaws_document_id         - Robaws document reference
✅ robaws_uploaded_at         - Upload timestamp
✅ upload_status              - 'pending', 'uploaded', 'failed'
✅ upload_error               - Error message storage
✅ upload_method              - 'direct' or 'bucket' tracking
✅ original_filename          - Better file tracking
```

### **4. Enhanced Integration Pipeline**
```php
✅ ExtractDocumentData.php    - Automatic upload after extraction
✅ RobawsOfferController.php  - File upload in quotation creation
✅ New API endpoints          - Upload management and status checking
```

## 🚀 **Supported Upload Scenarios**

### **File Size Routing**
- **≤6MB files**: Direct upload to entity (`uploadDirectToEntity`)
- **>6MB files**: Temp bucket workflow (`createTempBucket` → `uploadToBucket` → `attachDocumentFromBucket`)

### **Document Types**
- **PDF files**: `application/pdf` (8 files ready)
- **Images**: `image/png` (12 files), `image/jpeg` (3 files)  
- **Email files**: `message/rfc822`
- **Mixed batches**: Multiple types in single quotation

### **Collection Strategies**
1. **Primary document**: Document linked to quotation
2. **Related by Robaws ID**: All documents with same `robaws_quotation_id`
3. **Related by intake**: All documents from same intake process

## 📡 **API Endpoints**

### **File Upload Management**
```bash
# Upload all documents for a quotation
POST /robaws/quotations/{quotationId}/upload-documents

# Get upload status and progress
GET /robaws/quotations/{quotationId}/upload-status

# Retry failed uploads
POST /robaws/quotations/{quotationId}/retry-uploads

# Enhanced quotation creation with file upload
POST /documents/{document}/robaws-offer
```

### **Response Format**
```json
{
  "message": "Document upload process completed",
  "quotation_id": "11412",
  "upload_results": [
    {
      "file": "document.pdf",
      "status": "success",
      "method": "direct",
      "document_id": "robaws-doc-123"
    }
  ],
  "total_files": 3,
  "successful": 2,
  "failed": 1
}
```

## 🔧 **Usage Examples**

### **Automatic Upload (Built-in)**
```php
// After AI extraction, files automatically upload
ExtractDocumentData::dispatch($document);
// → AI extraction → Robaws quotation → File upload
```

### **Manual Upload**
```php
$uploadService = app(MultiDocumentUploadService::class);

// Upload all documents for a quotation
$results = $uploadService->uploadQuotationDocuments($quotation);

// Upload single document
$result = $uploadService->uploadDocumentToQuotation($document);

// Get status
$status = $uploadService->getUploadStatus($quotation);

// Retry failures
$retryResults = $uploadService->retryFailedUploads($quotation);
```

### **API Usage**
```bash
# Upload documents via API
curl -X POST \
  "http://your-domain.com/robaws/quotations/11412/upload-documents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"

# Check status
curl -X GET \
  "http://your-domain.com/robaws/quotations/11412/upload-status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Command**
```bash
# Test with dry run
php artisan test:multi-document-upload --dry-run

# Test specific quotation
php artisan test:multi-document-upload --quotation-id=11412

# Full test with actual uploads
php artisan test:multi-document-upload
```

### **Test Scenarios**
- ✅ API connectivity validation
- ✅ Document discovery and collection
- ✅ File size routing (direct vs bucket)
- ✅ Multi-format support (PDF, PNG, JPEG)
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Status tracking and reporting

## 📊 **Current Database State**

**Ready for Upload:**
- **Quotation 13** → Robaws ID 11412 (PNG file, 739KB)
- **Quotation 12** → Robaws ID 11411 (PNG file, 739KB)  
- **Quotation 11** → Robaws ID 11410 (PNG file, 208KB)
- **Quotation 10** → Robaws ID 11409 (PNG file, 1.2MB)
- **Quotation 9** → Robaws ID 11408 (PDF file, 154KB)
