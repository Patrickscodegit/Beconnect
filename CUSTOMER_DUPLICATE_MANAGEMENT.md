# Customer Duplicate Management - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview

A comprehensive duplicate detection and merge system has been implemented for Robaws customers in Filament. This allows you to easily find, merge, and clean up duplicate customer records while preserving all related intakes.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Duplicate Detection Badge** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- A warning badge appears in the customer table for any customer with duplicates
- Shows total count (e.g., "3 total" means 1 original + 2 duplicates)
- Includes tooltip explaining the duplicate status
- Icon: üîÑ document-duplicate

### 2. **Find Duplicates Button** üîç
- Located in the table header actions
- Automatically filters the table to show only customers with duplicates
- Displays a notification with duplicate statistics
- Makes it easy to focus on cleanup work

### 3. **Duplicate Filter** üéØ
- Toggle filter: "Has Duplicates"
- Quickly show/hide customers with duplicates
- Works alongside other filters (role, country, etc.)

### 4. **Smart Merge Bulk Action** ‚ö°
- Select multiple duplicate customers
- Click "Merge Duplicates" bulk action
- System automatically suggests the best record to keep based on:
  - Number of related intakes (highest priority)
  - Data completeness (email, phone, VAT, etc.)
  - Valid Robaws ID (not temporary "NEW_" IDs)
  - Age of record (oldest = original)
- Preview what will happen before confirming
- All intakes are preserved and linked to the primary record
- Transaction-based (all-or-nothing) for data safety

### 5. **Safe Delete Protection** üõ°Ô∏è
- Cannot delete customers that have intakes
- Clear error message shows intake count
- Bulk delete checks all records before proceeding
- Prevents accidental data loss

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Find and Merge All Duplicates (Recommended)

1. Go to **Robaws Customers** page
2. Click **"Find Duplicates"** button in header
3. Table shows only customers with duplicates
4. Sort by **name** to group duplicates together
5. Select all instances of a duplicate name (e.g., all 9 "Nancy Deckers")
6. Click **"Merge Duplicates"** in bulk actions dropdown
7. Modal shows all selected records with details:
   - Name
   - Email
   - City
   - Robaws Client ID
8. System suggests the best record (pre-selected)
9. Review and confirm (or select a different primary)
10. Click **"Merge"**
11. ‚úÖ Success! All duplicates merged, intakes preserved

**Repeat for each duplicate group.**

### Workflow 2: Merge Specific Customer

1. Search for a customer name (e.g., "Unknown")
2. See duplicate badge showing "31 total"
3. Click the duplicate badge or enable "Has Duplicates" filter
4. Select the records you want to merge
5. Follow merge process from Workflow 1

### Workflow 3: Clean Up Empty Duplicates

1. Click **"Find Duplicates"**
2. Look for customers with minimal data (e.g., "Unknown", no email)
3. Check if they have intakes (see "Intakes" column)
4. Select duplicates **without intakes**
5. Click **"Delete"** bulk action
6. Confirm deletion
7. ‚úÖ Clean records removed

### Workflow 4: View Duplicate Group Details

1. See duplicate badge on any customer row
2. Click customer name to edit
3. Scroll to see all fields
4. Go back and compare with other duplicates
5. Select which one to keep as primary

## Technical Implementation

### Services Created

#### `CustomerDuplicateService`
- `findDuplicateGroups()` - Get all duplicate groups
- `getDuplicatesFor($customer)` - Get duplicates for specific customer
- `suggestPrimaryRecord($duplicates)` - Smart suggestion algorithm
- `hasDuplicates($customer)` - Check if customer has duplicates
- `getDuplicateCount($customer)` - Count duplicates

#### `CustomerMergeService`
- `merge($primary, $duplicateIds)` - Transaction-based merge
- `mergeFields($primary, $duplicate)` - Field-by-field merging
- `previewMerge($primary, $duplicateIds)` - Preview without executing
- `canSafelyDelete($customer)` - Check deletion safety

### Model Methods Added to `RobawsCustomerCache`

```php
hasDuplicates(): bool
getDuplicates(): Collection
getDuplicateCount(): int
scopeWithDuplicates($query)
getNameWithDetailsAttribute(): string
```

### Filament Table Enhancements

- **New Column**: `duplicate_status` with badge
- **New Filter**: `has_duplicates` toggle
- **New Bulk Action**: `merge` with smart suggestions
- **Enhanced Bulk Action**: `delete` with intake protection
- **Updated Header Action**: `findDuplicates` applies filter

## Merge Logic Details

### Field Merging Strategy
When merging, the system:
1. Keeps the primary record
2. For each field (email, phone, address, etc.):
   - If primary has a value ‚Üí keep primary's value
   - If primary is empty but duplicate has value ‚Üí use duplicate's value
3. Metadata is merged (both preserved, primary takes precedence)
4. All intakes updated to point to primary record
5. Duplicates deleted

### Scoring System (for suggestions)
Points awarded to each record:
- **Email**: +10 points
- **Phone**: +8 points
- **Mobile**: +6 points
- **VAT Number**: +7 points
- **Address**: +5 points
- **City**: +3 points
- **Country**: +3 points
- **Website**: +2 points
- **Each Intake**: +20 points (very important!)
- **Valid Robaws ID**: +15 points

Highest score = suggested primary record

## Safety Features

1. ‚úÖ **Database Transactions**: All merges are atomic (all-or-nothing)
2. ‚úÖ **Intake Preservation**: Intakes always updated before deletion
3. ‚úÖ **Delete Protection**: Cannot delete customers with intakes
4. ‚úÖ **Confirmation Modals**: User must confirm all actions
5. ‚úÖ **Clear Previews**: Shows what will happen before executing
6. ‚úÖ **Detailed Logging**: All merges logged to Laravel logs
7. ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Rollback on failure, clear error messages

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenario 1: Simple Merge (2 duplicates)
- Customer: "Nancy Deckers" (9 duplicates in production)
- Expected: Merge all 9 into 1, preserve all intakes
- Verify: Check intakes still linked correctly

### Test Scenario 2: Bulk Delete (no intakes)
- Customer: "Unknown" entries without intakes
- Expected: Delete without errors
- Verify: Customers removed from database

### Test Scenario 3: Protected Delete (with intakes)
- Try to delete customer with intakes
- Expected: Error message, deletion blocked
- Verify: Customer not deleted, intakes safe

### Test Scenario 4: Data Merging
- Duplicate A: has email, no phone
- Duplicate B: no email, has phone
- Expected: Merged record has both email and phone
- Verify: Both fields populated in primary record

## Production Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ Code committed to main branch
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub
- üöÄ Forge will auto-deploy to production
- ‚è≥ Wait ~2 minutes for deployment

### Post-Deployment Checklist

1. ‚úÖ Verify Filament cache cleared (`php artisan filament:cache-components`)
2. Test "Find Duplicates" button works
3. Test duplicate badge appears
4. Test merge action with 2-3 duplicates first
5. Monitor Laravel logs for any errors
6. Check intake relationships after merge

## Statistics (Based on Production Data)

From your current data:
- **Total Customers**: 4,017
- **Duplicate Groups**: Multiple (including "Nancy Deckers" with 9, "Unknown" with 31)
- **Estimated Cleanup**: Could reduce to ~3,800 customers after deduplication

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test in production with small duplicate groups
2. **Short-term**: Clean up obvious duplicates (Unknown, Nancy Deckers, etc.)
3. **Medium-term**: Consider auto-deduplication on import
4. **Long-term**: Implement duplicate prevention at creation time

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
- Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Look for entries with: "Customer merge" or "Duplicate"
- Common issues:
  - Intake relationship errors (check foreign keys)
  - Transaction timeouts (merge too many at once)
  - Filament cache issues (run `php artisan filament:cache-components`)
