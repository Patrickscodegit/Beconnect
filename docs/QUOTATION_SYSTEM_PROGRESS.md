## Testing Checklist

### Can Test Now
- [x] Run migrations
- [ ] Configure .env
- [ ] Sync Robaws articles
- [ ] Verify articles cached correctly
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Check models work correctly

### Cannot Test Yet
- Quotation request creation (controllers not built)
- Schedule article suggestion UI (needs integration with existing page)
- Customer/prospect portals (not built)
- Email notifications (not built)
- Webhooks (not approved by Robaws)

## Architecture Verification

### Non-Interference Checklist
- âœ… No modifications to `shipping_schedules` table
- âœ… No modifications to `intakes` table
- âœ… No modifications to `ScheduleController.php`
- âœ… No modifications to `IntakeCreationService.php` (yet - will add at end)
- âœ… All new tables use foreign keys safely (SET NULL or CASCADE)
- âœ… Separate controllers for all new functionality
- âœ… Feature-flagged via `config/quotation.php`

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# 2. Copy environment variables
# See docs/QUOTATION_SYSTEM_ENV_VARIABLES.md

# 3. Sync articles from Robaws
php artisan robaws:sync-articles

# 4. Check sync status
php artisan tinker
>>> \App\Models\RobawsSyncLog::latest()->first()
>>> \App\Models\RobawsArticleCache::count()
```

## Known Issues / Notes

- Webhooks are built but disabled (waiting for Robaws approval)
- Email safety is configured for 'safe' mode by default
- Schedule integration widget can be included via AJAX or blade include
- System uses existing 'documents' disk (local in dev, DO Spaces in prod)

## Next Session Priorities

1. Continue with Phase 4: Public Schedule Section
2. Continue with Phase 5: Prospect Quotation Portal
3. Build file upload functionality
4. Create email notification system with safety
5. Build Filament admin resources

**Estimated Completion**: Phases 1-3 complete (~30% of total plan)
**Current Status**: Foundation built, ready for user-facing features
