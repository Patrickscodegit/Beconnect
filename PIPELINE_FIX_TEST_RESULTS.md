## What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- `ExtractPdfDataJob`, `ExtractEmailDataJob`, and `ExtractImageDataJob` were using wrong namespace
- Wrong: `use App\Services\Extraction\ExtractionService;`
- Actual: `use App\Services\ExtractionService;`

### Solution:
1. Fixed import statements in all 3 jobs
2. Fixed method calls from `extractFromFile($path, $disk, $strategy)` to `extractFromFile(IntakeFile $file)`
3. Updated result handling to work with array return type instead of ExtractionResult object

### Impact:
- ✅ Intake processing now works for PDF, Email, and Image files
- ✅ No more `BindingResolutionException` errors
- ✅ Pipeline isolation working as designed
- ✅ Extraction data properly stored in documents table

## Next Steps

1. **✅ DONE** - Unit tests passing
2. **PENDING** - User testing with real PDF upload
3. **PENDING** - User testing commodity auto-population
4. **PENDING** - Production deployment

**Recommendation**: Proceed with manual testing in Filament Admin panel.
